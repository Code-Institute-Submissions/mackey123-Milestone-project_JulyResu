       <h2 class="info-back">Hobbies</h2>
          <p> When I am not coding my hobbies include production as in making of electronic music and mixing which involves mixing dance songs like a DJ would, I also have a passion for dancing
             and the outdooors such as hiking or sightseeing! Sports is also a fond hobbie of mine such as Jiu jitsu, I have not had much time to do so lately with lockdown so we set up a mat in my house which has definitely helped to keep me sane! I am also very fond of a good Documentary or film when not coding or making music. </p>

    <div class="col order-12">
      <h2 class="info-back">Intrests</h2> 
       <p>My main intrests would be making music learning history and geography. I also have a love of travelling which of course ties in with geography and music!
           from a young age I have had a huge intrest in all kinds of music which is basically down to my older brothers and parents who are also very fond of it,which I am very grateful for! 
           My other big interest would have to be History,if I had not of done coding I would have been studying history by now I reckon.

      <div class="col order-1">
         <h2 class="info-back">Goals</h2>
          <p>My biggest goals would be to make it as producer or 
           DJ and to become a Software developer which I am on the way to already! Of course I cant forget my biggest and most relevant goal becomming a full stack developer. This is my current goal and one in which I am already closer to already.I also have one last goal which is to become a black belt before the time I am 30. I wish to get this in Jiu jitsu I am currentlly 21 so only 9 years to go! </p>
