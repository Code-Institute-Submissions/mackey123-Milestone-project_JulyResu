## Testing code

During the course of creating this project I had to test very often.
My most often and most used format of testing was the inspect and lighthouse dev from google tools.

I had to run every bit of code I made through the w33 Validator I would do this in the following way

a. First I would copy all the code for the page I am on.

b. I would then open a W3 Validator.

c. Copy and the paste the code I had into the direct input.

d. This would give me any errors or code that was invalid.

e. I would then correct the invalid code and put the code again to make sure there were no errors.



## Corrections made to code through the use of W3 Validator

#### Home page
### Upon entering my code through the w33 Validator I came back with a error or two sometimes more on every page.

1. My H5 element on line 66 and line 68 could not continue as it cannot be listed as a element of Ul.

2. I had a duplicate Div closing tag on line 85 Which I removed. I also did this with a li element on line 92.



#### Contact page

1. The a element on line 64 had to be changed to a form so I could use the correct "action" attribute to allow the user to be taken to a new page 
once they click on the submit button.

2. On line 51 of the contact page I removed a excess h5 element that had no use. Removed a excess closing form tag as well.

#### About page

1. On the about page the only error was a bad value for my image tag according to w3 Validator.

#### CSS

1. Upon entering it into the validator I had to remove two rules as they did not have values that made sense.


#### Work History page

1. After entering my code in the validator I had to change the P element from under every h4 tag on the page as it could not be a child of a ul element.

2. I also had to wrap the h4 tags in li elements as they could not be children of a ul element.

#### Info pages

1. There was no direct error from the validator for the about page.

#### Contact page 2 

1. Stray footers as they were not in body tags added them within to fix this.



## Testing site on different devices


This project is responsive on a all types of screens and has been tested for all with the use of inspect tools by google and lighthouse.

To test its responsiveness I would do it in the following way.

i.  First open up Google tools by clicking the three dots in the top right corner of the page.

ii.  I would then click on a mobile or tablet device and begin to browse through the website as normal.

iii.  I would then repeat this process on all devices on inspect tools and go through the whole site taking part in all the interactions to make sure they performed well.

## Changes made

Following this process the problem that arose was the home page contact details, the email would be out of frame to the right when on a mobile device.

To fix this I changed the font size to a percentage rather then a px value. You can see this on 81 of my style.css page.

## Testing individual features and sections

Some code or features had to be tested quite regularly to make sure it was always working well.


#### 1.Contact form

i. The contact form had to be tested after every new feature was added or taken away

ii. This involved typing in all the input boxes and clicking enter to make sure everything was required

iii. I then had to repeat this on the mobile device and so on using the google inspect tool




#### 2. Image of me on About page

i.  Originally had a square image in top left but was not responsive

ii.   Had to add different styles to allow it to sit in the center and to become a avatar image

iii.  Tested on google tools on all devices to make sure it came out correctly


#### 3. Navbar and CV download button

i.    Had trouble turning it into a button, had to re add the anchor links and placemnet of tags

ii.   Had to add a li tag instead of p as it was not suitable

iii.  Tested on all devices and clicked link on all to make sure it opened the tab in another page

## Known bugs

i. 
 
 Known bug from start of the project was sometimes having to refresh the page when google dev tools were opened,
Seems to happen a lot less since new navbar was added but if it happen a simple refresh can fix it.

ii. 
 
 Another known bug was the CSS in the project not been applied to the whole project,
to get around this you have to kill gitpod with the command "pkill-python3" and restart the workspace and code will return to normal.

iii. 

On the w33 validator it has come to a error on my form within a form from line 64 to 84 of the contact.html page,
 there is another form within however after replacing it with inputs and moving around the elements
I can not find a solution which allows me to have the same submit and correct contact form as the one in this project.
The terminal does not recognise is as a error and the contact form works better with it so , thats why I have it down as a bug.

# Deployment
To run my code on Github pages do as follows

1. Open up your Github and navigate to your repository.

2. Under the Repository section click settings.

3. Locate Git hub pages by scrolling down and underneath it click the drop-down menu to select a folder for your publishing source.

4. Click save and locate the link under the same section and click into the site.

## Run code Locally
#### To run my code locally follow these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository

2. Under the repo name click Clone.

3. To clone a copy of the repo using HTTPS, copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS".

4. Using your IDE of choice open up your preferred terminal.

5. Navigate to your desired file location.

6. Copy the link and input it into your terminal to clone my project.

#### You can get more of this information in more detail here: (https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

#### Changes after deployment 

After deoploying my site I had a few issues regarding the styling to fix this I commited everything once over.

I had to change my image tag to allow the image to display properly as it waas not before.
