## Testing code

During the course of creating this project I had to test very often.
My most often and most used format of testing was the inspect and lighthouse dev from google tools.

I had to run every bit of code I made through the w33 Validator I would do this in the following way

a. First I would copy all the code for the page I am on.

b. I would then open a W3 Validator.

c. Copy and the paste the code I had into the direct input.

i. This would give me any errors or code that was invalid.

ii. I would then correct the invalid code and put the code again to make sure there was no errors.

## Corrections made to code through the use of W3 Validator

#### Home page
### Upon entering my code through the w33 Validator I came back with a error or two sometimes more on every page.

1. My H5 element on line 66 and line 68 could not continue as it cannot be listed as a elemnt of Ul.

2. I had a duplicate Div closing tag on line 85 Which I removed. I also did this with a li elemnt on line 92.



#### Contact page

1. The a element on line 64 had to be changed to a form so I could use the correct "action" attribute to allow the user to be taken to a new page 
once they click on the submit button.

2. On line 51 of the contact page I removed a excess h5 elemnt that had no use. Removed a excess closing form tag also.

#### About page

1. On the about page the only error was a bad value for my image tag according to w3 Validator.

#### CSS

1. Upon entering it into the validator I had to remove two rules as they did not have values that made sense.


#### Work History page

1. After entering my code in the validator I had to change the P elemnt from under every h4 tag on the page as it could not be a child of a ul element.

2. I also had to wrap the h4 tags in li elemnts as they could not be children of a ul elemnt.

#### Info pages

1. There was no direct error from the validator for the about page.

#### Contact page 2 



## Testing site on diffrent devices


This project is responsive on a all types of screens and has been tested for all with the use of inspect tools by google and lighthouse.

To test its responsiveness I would do it in the following way.

i. First open up Google tools by clicking the three dots in the top right corner of the page.

ii. I would then click on a mobile or tablet device and begin to browse through the website as normal.

iii. I would then repeat this process on all devices on inspect tools and go through the whole site taking part in all the interactions to make sure they performed well.

## Changes made

Following this process the problem that arose was the home page contact details, the email would be out of frame to the right when on a mobile device.

To fix this I changed the font size to a precentage rather then a px value. You can see this on 81 of my style.css page.

## Testing individual features and sections

Some code or features had to be tested quite reguarly to make sure it was always working well.

1.Contact Form
